# Gmail Processing Pipeline with AI

This project is a pipeline that uses AI to automatically analyze incoming emails and extract structured data in real time.

It combines **Google Cloud Platform** and **Google AI services** to create a real-time, fully serverless processing pipeline to automate any process on your **Google Workspace** or even communicate with other platforms.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Email Notification**  
   Gmail is monitored using the Gmail APIâ€™s `watch()` method. When a new message arrives, a Pub/Sub notification is sent.

2. **Function Invocation**  
   The Pub/Sub event triggers a Google Cloud Function, initiating the pipeline.

3. **Email Content Retrieval**  
   The Cloud Function fetches the email body and attachments via the Gmail API for further processing.

4. **AI-Based Analysis**  
   Attachments and content are processed using AI services such as **Document AI** and **Gemini** to extract structure, context, or insights.

5. **Automated Data Storing**  
   The extracted data is stored (in this demo: to **Google Sheets**). In future use cases, this step can trigger **any automated output action** â€” such as sending alerts, replying to the email, or calling other systems.

> ðŸ’¡ Steps 1â€“3 form the core **communication layer**, while Steps 4â€“5 are **modular and customizable**, enabling flexible output workflows.

## Setup Instructions

Each part of the infrastructure can be setup following the specific instructions:

1. **Google Cloud Setup** â€“ enable APIs, create a project and service account  
2. **Gmail OAuth** â€“ register and authorize Gmail access  
3. **Secret Manager** â€“ store your Gmail token  
4. **Pub/Sub + Watch** â€“ configure the Gmail watch and Pub/Sub topic  
5. **Deploy the Function** â€“ deploy the Cloud Function  
6. **Run Locally** â€“ install dependencies and run helpers

See the `infra/` and `docs/` folders for full step-by-step instructions.
